        The word blog is a combined version of the words “web” and “log”. At
        their inception, blogs were essentially an online diary where people
        could keep a log about their daily lives, on the web. They have since
        morphed into an essential place for information and updates and have
        become a forum for not only individuals, but also businesses. In fact,
        some people even make money blogging and become professional, full-time
        bloggers. Blogs are regularly updated websites that provide essential
        insights into a certain topic. Different types of blogs cover varying
        topics, from food to fashion to marketing. Blogs are comprised of
        individual posts on more specific subjects within the blog’s field of
        expertise. These posts often serve as a platform for discussions, as
        many blogs have active comments sections. You can think of a blog almost
        as a newspaper that adds a new article every once in a while and
        continually maintains the older articles.
